    <p class="description">
      Phase 1 is where we get a vision of who you are. In phase 1 we look at
      different skills and try to find and match you to a career that values
      skills and certifications that you have already developed. Though we match
      you with a career in this phase, the true goal is to help you think about
      what abilities you have already gained, and help you to understand your
      desires for a career in IT.

      sector that you can fit into, and we let you explore. The goal is to help
      you understand the different careers including the time required to
      succeed and average salaries in this career. If you would like to explore
      the sectors and choose a path without being matched you can also click the
