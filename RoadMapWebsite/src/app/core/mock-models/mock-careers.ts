    "description": "(from Field engineer) Network Consultant\nThe Network Consultant is an experienced and educated professional who certifies network functionality and performance. They are responsible for designing, setting up and maintaining computer networks at either an organization or client location.\n\nConsultants meet with the organization�s manager, network engineers to discuss networking requirements. They next research the network�s performance and security. After careful analysis, they suggest changes, if any, for better functionality along with a cost-benefit analysis. Other consultants then review the installation and perform the testing of the new or existing network.\n\nIt is a broad title and includes a wide variety of work. A consultant might be a network architect, system administrator, security specialist or a related work specialist in the Telecom world. Many consultants are self-employed while others work full time. Consultants oversee the entire network to ensure the organization�s productivity. They also review the deployment of network firewalls and antivirus software.\n\nJob Description\nMany companies depend upon these consultants to guarantee network functionality and performance. Consultants research, recommend and deploy changes in network services either full time or on a freelance basis to an organization or client.\n\nThe job role might fluctuate based on the requirements or needs of a company, but they commonly include hardware/software installation, server planning, and availability, disaster recovery, network globalization, and Datacenter network setup. The following are job responsibilities common in this position:\n\nManage and administer technical issues for customers in a team\nIdentify and fix all onsite infrastructure issues\nMaintain IT infrastructure documentation\nAnalyze and coordinate network documentation with account managers\nPropose and implement the latest technology for increased network productivity\nSeveral system network consultants are independent, while others work for an organization that provides networking services. Most of these experts work full-time, and some extra time is common when the closing date is nearing of an organization.\n\nFew network consultants have the options of work from home, but this work is usually done in an organizational environment. At times the travel is required to the client sites may be required as per the requirement. The Network consulting is associated with limited physical demands or risks; they perform the remote work as per the need of the client.",

    "description": "Cyber security is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security. The term applies in a variety of contexts, from business to mobile computing, and can be divided into a few common categories.Network security is the practice of securing a computer network from intruders, whether targeted attackers or opportunistic malware.\nApplication security focuses on keeping software and devices free of threats. A compromised application could provide access to the data its designed to protect. Successful security begins in the design stage, well before a program or device is deployed.\nInformation security protects the integrity and privacy of data, both in storage and in transit.\nOperational security includes the processes and decisions for handling and protecting data assets. The permissions users have when accessing a network and the procedures that determine how and where data may be stored or shared all fall under this umbrella.\nDisaster recovery and business continuity define how an organization responds to a cyber-security incident or any other event that causes the loss of operations or data. Disaster recovery policies dictate how the organization restores its operations and information to return to the same operating capacity as before the event. Business continuity is the plan the organization falls back on while trying to operate without certain resources.\nEnd-user education addresses the most unpredictable cyber-security factor: people. Anyone can accidentally introduce a virus to an otherwise secure system by failing to follow good security practices. Teaching users to delete suspicious email attachments, not plug in unidentified USB drives, and various other important lessons is vital for the security of any organization.",
